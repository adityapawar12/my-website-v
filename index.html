                    <br />
                    I am a computer science graduate.
                    <br />
                    I like to do front-end web development.
                    <br />
                    I am learning how to use javascript frameworks such as React
                    and Angular.
                    <br />
                    I do not have any prior experience but i'd like to work as a
                    front end developer and hone my skills.
