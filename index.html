                <br>
                I am a computer science graduate.
                <br>
                I like to do front-end web development.
                <br>
                I am learning how to use javascript frameworks such as React and Angular.
                <br>
                I do not have any prior experience but i'd like to work as a front end developer and hone my skills.
